### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes but I felt like the lecutres really helped my ability to complete the project. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have liked to incorporate more stretch features such as a past orders page.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

My demo in class went well, it might be easier to pre record a demo to show just so that I remember to present all of the necessary points.

### Open-source libraries used
